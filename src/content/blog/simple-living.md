We're constantly told we need more. More stuff, more achievements, more connections. But what if the opposite were true?

## The Problem with More

Every possession requires:

- Space to store it
- Time to maintain it
- Mental energy to think about it

The same goes for commitments, subscriptions, and even relationships. More isn't automatically better.

## What Simple Living Looks Like

For me, it means:

1. **Fewer possessions** - Only keeping things I actually use
2. **Fewer commitments** - Saying no more often
3. **Fewer distractions** - Less social media, more reading

## The Benefits I've Noticed

Since simplifying my life, I've experienced:

- Less decision fatigue
- More time for things that matter
- Reduced anxiety about "keeping up"
- Better focus on creative work

## Getting Started

You don't have to become a minimalist overnight. Start small:

- Clear one drawer
- Unsubscribe from one newsletter
- Say no to one invitation

Small changes compound over time.

Simple doesn't mean boring. It means intentional. It means choosing what matters and letting go of what doesn't.
