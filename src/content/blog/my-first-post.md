Hello and welcome to my new blog! I'm excited to finally have a space to share my thoughts with the world.

## Why I Started This Blog

I've always wanted a simple place to write down my ideas. No fancy features, no distractions - just words on a page. This Craigslist-inspired design reflects that philosophy: **simple, functional, and focused on content**.

## What You'll Find Here

I plan to write about:

- **Technology** - Things I'm learning and building
- **Life observations** - Random thoughts about the world
- **Book notes** - Summaries and takeaways from what I read

## A Quick Note on Style

You might notice this blog looks a bit... retro. That's intentional! I wanted something that:

1. Loads fast
2. Works everywhere
3. Puts the focus on writing

No tracking, no ads, no nonsense. Just a blog.
