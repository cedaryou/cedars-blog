# Welcome to my new blog

I'm going to be writing on here whatever I feel like, maybe I'll try and keep a diary or something like this. I'll let everyone read my inner thoughts. Wouldn't that be nice? Maybe I can just stream of consciousness a few hundred words a day. Just let it rip every morning. That might feel good. I've always tried on and off to keep a journal, but I only ever really write in it when my life is falling apart. It's not ideal. If you look back at one of my journals it's just death, wife leaving, death... bleak stuff quite frankly.

Would also like to test if you can do paragraph breaks in this thing. That would be a nice feature. I think it should work well enough. Don't see why not. If not I might have to change this from something other than markdown. I don't mind markdown it feels minimalist and chic, however it seems it does have some formatting limitations. Ah well.

Anyways that should about do it for this first post. Here I'll try some *italics* and some **bolding** and maybe a different
