Today I was trying to do some rather dry torts readings and I found myself, as I often do, getting distracted by the constant stream of information coming from the twitter application on my phone. I thought to myself: "there must be some way to break this horrible cycle."

Deleting my account is of course not an option (that would be admitting defeat), and so naturally instead of simply putting down my phone I spent hours building myself an arcane "solution." This of course also had the added benefit of putting off my readings for another few hours or so. 

And so, armed with Claude code, zero technical knowledge, and a dream, I had the machine build me a new version of the SMS-to-tweet feature from the days of Twitter yore. 

The basic idea is simple: If I can tweet without having to look at the timeline, then I can get my posting fix, while not getting sucked into the dopamine loop. I can log out of the twitter app on my phone while I'm out for the day, and check the notifications on my desktop when I get home. 

Now, I can't really tell you much about how it works, since I don't really know, but I can say that when I iMessage a contact called "Twitter" in my phone it will automatically post whatever I text to my account, [including photos.](https://x.com/our_decay/status/2018854050041647126?s=20)

I doubt this will really do anything to curb my Twitter addiction, but it is a fun tool and I'm glad I could make Claude make it for me. The major downsides are that Twitter doesn't have free API usage, so I have to pay $0.01 every time I Text-to-Tweet, and also that I have to have my computer running for it to work.

Other than that I'm quite pleased with it. I don't really know how github works but I've uploaded it [here](https://github.com/cedaryou/textweet) on the understanding that you can download it and give it a try yourself, if you can figure it out. That's all for now. 

Very Best, 
Cedar

P.S. Please see below for my first test post. I would have included a screenshot of how it looks on my phone, but my website doesn't currently have that capability.
