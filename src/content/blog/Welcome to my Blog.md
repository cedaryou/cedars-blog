A couple of days ago I posted:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I believe that Craigslist is the pinnacle of web design and that every website should essentially look more or less like Craigslist</p>&mdash; Cedar You (@our_decay) <a href="https://twitter.com/our_decay/status/2016712908244185464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 29, 2026</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

And I got to thinking... maybe I should have my own website that looks more or less like craigslist. So I got claude code and now here we are. It's extremely simple and just uses markdown so that I can write my posts in obsidian, which I've started using since the founder followed me on twitter (evidence of his good taste). 

I must admit I had reservations about claude code, but it's extremely fun to use. It's sort of like playing toys with the computer; more or less how I imagined "hacking" as an 8 year old... "Computer, build me a website." 

I also had it make me a newsletter feature, so you can get my posts in your email if you so choose. However, it will break if I get over 100 subscribers, so please don't exceed the subscriber count (bottom right). 

That's all for today. 

Best, 
Cedar
