Learning to code can feel overwhelming. Here are some things I wish someone had told me earlier.

## Start Small

Don't try to build Facebook on day one. Start with tiny projects:

- A simple calculator
- A to-do list
- A personal webpage

Each small project teaches you something new.

## It's Okay to Copy (At First)

When you're learning, it's fine to follow tutorials and copy code. That's how you learn patterns. Just make sure you:

1. Type it out yourself (don't copy-paste)
2. Try to understand each line
3. Experiment by changing things

## Error Messages Are Your Friends

```
TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined
```

This used to terrify me. Now I know it's just the computer telling me exactly what's wrong. Read error messages carefully - they usually point you to the problem.

## You Don't Need to Know Everything

Nobody knows everything. Even senior developers Google things constantly. What matters is:

- Knowing how to search for answers
- Understanding fundamentals
- Being willing to learn

## Take Breaks

Stuck on a bug? Walk away. Seriously.

> Some of my best debugging happens in the shower or on a walk. Your brain keeps working on problems in the background.

Come back with fresh eyes and you'll often see the solution immediately.

Keep building. Keep learning. You've got this.
